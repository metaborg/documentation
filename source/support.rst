Getting Support

Spoofax is an open source project. We welcome contributions from the community.

Spoofax is developed by the TU Delft Programming Languages group.
We do our best to make Spoofax usable by everyone and to help you when you encounter issues.
However, our resources are limited, so please be patient.

Documentation

This documentation is the intended to be the first source of information on all things Spoofax.
So, please read carefully.

Bug Reports and Feature Requests

In the Spoofax 2.0 Eclipse plugin, use the main menu <span class='menuselection'>Spoofax (meta) ‣ Report issue</span> to report issues, it provides a link to the `Spoofax <https://yellowgrass.org/project/Spoofax>`_  project and the environment versions which you can copy paste.

When reporting bugs, please provide the following information such that we can easily reproduce and fix the bug:
​
* Environment details (can be copy pasted from <span class='menuselection'>Spoofax (meta) ‣ Report</span> main menu)

  * Eclipse/IntelliJ package and version
  * Spoofax version
  * Operating system name, architecture, and version
  
* High-level description of the bug
