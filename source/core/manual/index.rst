This is the reference manual for the Spoofax Core API.
The Spoofax Core API is a Java API for building and running languages made with Spoofax.
To this end, the API exposes services for building languages, language processing services such as parsers, analyzers, and transformations, and editor services such as (info, warning, error) messages, syntax highlighting, reference resolution, code completion.

The introduction gives an overview of the concepts, architecture, and services of the API.
The rest of the manual goes into more detail on these subjects.
