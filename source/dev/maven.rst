Maven
=====

Maven is a project management and build tool for software projects. Most components in Spoofax are built with Maven.

Installing
----------

Maven can be downloaded and installed from http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi. We require Maven 3.3.9 or higher.
On macOs, Maven can be easily installed with Homebrew by executing ``brew install maven``.

Confirm the installation and version by running ``mvn --version``.

Memory allocation
-----------------

By default, Maven does not assign a lot of memory to the JVM that it runs in, which may lead to out of memory exceptions during builds.
To increase the allocated memory, execute before building:

.. code:: bash

    export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xms512m -Xmx1024m -Xss16m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m"

.. note:: Such an export is not permanent, see previous note about making this permanent.

.. note:: ``-XX:MaxPermSize=512m`` is not required for Java 8, and even gives a warning when added.

.. _using_metaborg_artifacts:

Proxy settings
--------------

If you are behind a proxy, please put the proxy settings in your ``~/.m2/settings.xml``. When you use the ``b`` script to build Spoofax, the ``MAVEN_OPTS`` environment variable is overridden to ensure the memory options above are supplied, so using commandline options in the environment variable for the proxy settings does not work. 

Spoofax Maven artifacts
-----------------------

Spoofax's Maven artifacts are hosted on our artifact server: http://artifacts.metaborg.org.
To use these artifacts, repositories have to be added to your Maven configuration.
This configuration is *required* when building and developing Spoofax.
Repositories can be added to your local Maven settings file (which is recommended), or to a project's POM file.

Local settings file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The recommended approach is to add repositories to your local Maven settings file, located at :file:`~/.m2/settings.xml`.
If you have not created this file yet, or want to completely replace it, simply create it with the following content:

.. code:: xml

    <?xml version="1.0" ?>
    <settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
      xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd">
      <profiles>
        <profile>
          <id>add-metaborg-release-repos</id>
          <activation>
            <activeByDefault>true</activeByDefault>
          </activation>
          <repositories>
            <repository>
              <id>metaborg-release-repo</id>
              <url>http://artifacts.metaborg.org/content/repositories/releases/</url>
              <releases>
                <enabled>true</enabled>
              </releases>
              <snapshots>
                <enabled>false</enabled>
              </snapshots>
            </repository>
          </repositories>
          <pluginRepositories>
            <pluginRepository>
              <id>metaborg-release-repo</id>
              <url>http://artifacts.metaborg.org/content/repositories/releases/</url>
              <releases>
                <enabled>true</enabled>
              </releases>
              <snapshots>
                <enabled>false</enabled>
              </snapshots>
            </pluginRepository>
          </pluginRepositories>
        </profile>

        <profile>
          <id>add-metaborg-snapshot-repos</id>
          <activation>
            <activeByDefault>true</activeByDefault>
          </activation>
          <repositories>
            <repository>
              <id>metaborg-snapshot-repo</id>
              <url>http://artifacts.metaborg.org/content/repositories/snapshots/</url>
              <releases>
                <enabled>false</enabled>
              </releases>
              <snapshots>
                <enabled>true</enabled>
              </snapshots>
            </repository>
          </repositories>
          <pluginRepositories>
            <pluginRepository>
              <id>metaborg-snapshot-repo</id>
              <url>http://artifacts.metaborg.org/content/repositories/snapshots/</url>
              <releases>
                <enabled>false</enabled>
              </releases>
              <snapshots>
                <enabled>true</enabled>
              </snapshots>
            </pluginRepository>
          </pluginRepositories>
        </profile>
      </profiles>
    </settings>

If you've already created a settings file before and want to add the repositories, just add the ``profile`` element (and the ``profiles`` element if it does not exist yet) to the settings file.

Advanced: project POM file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Repositories can also be added directly to a project's POM file, which only set the repositories for that particular project. This is not recommended, because it makes repositories harder to change by users, and duplicates the configuration. But it can be convenient, because it does not require an external settings file.

To do this, just add the the following content to the POM file:

.. code:: xml

    <repositories>
        <repository>
            <id>metaborg-release-repo</id>
            <url>http://artifacts.metaborg.org/content/repositories/releases/</url>
            <releases>
                <enabled>true</enabled>
            </releases>
            <snapshots>
                <enabled>false</enabled>
            </snapshots>
        </repository>
        <repository>
            <id>metaborg-snapshot-repo</id>
            <url>http://artifacts.metaborg.org/content/repositories/snapshots/</url>
            <releases>
                <enabled>false</enabled>
            </releases>
            <snapshots>
                <enabled>true</enabled>
            </snapshots>
        </repository>
    </repositories>

    <pluginRepositories>
        <pluginRepository>
            <id>metaborg-release-repo</id>
            <url>http://artifacts.metaborg.org/content/repositories/releases/</url>
            <releases>
                <enabled>true</enabled>
            </releases>
            <snapshots>
                <enabled>false</enabled>
            </snapshots>
        </pluginRepository>
        <pluginRepository>
            <id>metaborg-snapshot-repo</id>
            <url>http://artifacts.metaborg.org/content/repositories/snapshots/</url>
            <releases>
                <enabled>false</enabled>
            </releases>
            <snapshots>
                <enabled>true</enabled>
            </snapshots>
        </pluginRepository>
    </pluginRepositories>

Maven central repository mirror
-------------------------------

Artifacts of most open source projects are hosted on the `Central Repository <https://search.maven.org/>`_ server. If you are building any project using Maven, many artifacts will be downloaded from that server. While it is a fast server, it can still take a while to download all required artifacts for big projects.

If you are on the TUDelft network, you can use our local mirror of the Central Repository to speed things up. Using the mirroring requires a change in your local settings.xml file located at :file:`~/.m2/settings.xml`. If this file does not exist, create it with the following content:

.. code:: xml

    <?xml version="1.0" ?>
    <settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
      xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd">
      <mirrors>
        <mirror>
          <id>metaborg-central-mirror</id>
          <url>http://artifacts.metaborg.org/content/repositories/central/</url>
          <mirrorOf>central</mirrorOf>
        </mirror>
      </mirrors>
    </settings>

If you've already created a settings file before and want to add the mirror configuration, just add the ``mirror`` element (and the ``mirrors`` element if it does not exist yet) to the settings file.
