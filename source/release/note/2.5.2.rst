Changes
-------

NaBL2
~~~~~

A bug introduced in 2.5.1 would remove the parse error in the editor as soon as analysis failed. This bug has been fixed. 

FlowSpec
~~~~~~~~

A whole host of bugs has been fixed in FlowSpec, mostly ones that lead to no clear error message. Much of the system has also been optimized for speed. 

Stratego
~~~~~~~~

Separate compilation for Stratego was added in this release. It is currently still experimental. It is documented as a separate item under the Stratego documentation, including instructions on how to opt-in to it and what its limitations are.

The Stratego primitives ``all``, ``some`` and ``one`` sometimes lost annotations and origins of list tails when an element in the list was transformed. This bug has been fixed.
