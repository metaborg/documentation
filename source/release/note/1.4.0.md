# Spoofax 1.4.0 (06-03-2015)

We're happy to announce the release of Spoofax 1.4.0, a minor release with SDF3 fixes and improvements to language plugins.

## Changes

#### SDF3

* Fix: [Supporting Windows line endings in SDF3.](https://yellowgrass.org/issue/SDF/77)
* Fix: [Providing warnings for literals that could be placeholders.](https://yellowgrass.org/issue/SDF/86)

#### Language plugins

###### Reduced download size of deployed plugins

Previously, when creating an Eclipse update site for your language (see [tutorial](https://metaborg.org/spoofax/tour/##plugin-deployment)), the result was a ~90MB download that included meta-tools such as SDF3 and NaBL. We brought the download size down to ~60MB by removing dependencies to some of the meta-tools, since end-users of deployed languages don't need them. In the future, we plan to bring the size further down by removing more dependencies.

###### Setting Java VM options for your language

For Spoofax and Spoofax-based languages to run smoothly, it is recommended to set Java's `-server` flag and to increase the stack size and memory allocation pool:

* `-Xss<size>` specifies the thread stack size
* `-Xmx<size>` specifies the maximum size, in bytes, of the memory allocation pool.
* `-server` selects server application runtime optimizations.

The server VM will take longer to start and “warm up” but will be more aggressively optimized. The `-server`  option only affects 32-bit VMs and has influence on 64-bit VMs because these always use server optimizations. These options can be configured in `eclipse.ini` as described on the [download](https://metaborg.org/download/) page. The recommended settings for Spoofax are `-server -Xss8m -Xmx1024m` and a warning will pop-up if Eclipse is started with settings that are too low.

Previously, the same settings were assumed for deployed plugins and were enforced by a similar pup-up warning. With Spoofax 1.4.0, language developers can choose their own Java VM settings, which are then recommended to end-users of their language. This can be configured in `editor/yourlang.main.esv`. The syntax is as follows:

```
jvm opts: [-server | -X[ss|mx]<size>[g|G|m|M|k|K]]+
```

For example: `jvm opts: -server -Xss8m -Xmx1024m`. If multiple Spoofax-based languages are installed, the configuration warning will tell how `eclipse.ini` needs to be updated such that the requirements of all languages are satisfied.
