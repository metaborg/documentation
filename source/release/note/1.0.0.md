# Spoofax 1.0.0 (28-12-2011)

We're pleased to announce the release of Spoofax 1.0.0.
A number of significant new features have been added since the last stable release, a long list of bugs has been fixed, and various minor improvements were
introduced.

Highlights of the release include:

-   Support for [writing tests for language definitions](../../langdev/meta/lang/spt/spt.rst)
-   Support for defining refactorings
-   Major improvements to content completion:
    [Spoofax/289](https://yellowgrass.org/issue/Spoofax/289),
    [Spoofax/357](https://yellowgrass.org/issue/Spoofax/357)
-   Support for using rewrite rules to disambiguate syntax:
    [Spoofax/328](https://yellowgrass.org/issue/Spoofax/328)

In addition to these features, we're actively working on improving Spoofax with new features.
In particular, we are now working on providing full support for debugging, on an interactive shell for Stratego and custom languages, and a new meta-language called SpoofaxLang to define languages in a more modular fashion.

A full list of feature requests and issues addressed in the new version is provided at <https://yellowgrass.org/tag/Spoofax/1.0>.
