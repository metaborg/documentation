=======================================
Static Semantics Definition with Statix
=======================================

Programs that are syntactically well-formed are not necessarily valid programs. 
Programming languages typically impose additional *context-sensitive* requirements on programs that cannot be captured in a syntax definition. 
Languages use names to identify reusable units that can be invoked at multiple parts in a program. 
In addition, statically typed languages require that expressions are consistently typed.
The Statix language supports the specification of name binding and type checking rules of a language.
The rules of the static semantics are written as logic rules, and solved using a constraint-based approach, and uses scope graphs for name resolution.
