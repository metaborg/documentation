REPL environment
================

The **Spoofax REPL** provides an interactive environment for
evaluating expressions in your language, much like the REPLs provided
by for example Haskell and Python. The REPL is useful for quickly
experimenting with code snippets, by allowing the code snippets to be
evaluated in the context of previous evaluations.

This part of the documentation explains how to install and configure
the REPL to work for your language.

.. note:: The REPL for Spoofax is still in development. As such, it
   currently only supports languages that use DynSem for their dynamic
   semantics specification.
